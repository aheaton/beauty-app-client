<h3>Planning and Strategy:</h3>
<p>I came up with the following plan of action in approaching my project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test user authentication CRUD on backend via Postman</li>
<li>Setup auth on front-end</li>
<li>Setup basic layout on frontend for routine screens, such as tab structure</li>
<li>Code up and test routine on backend via Postman</li>
<li>Tie backend into frontend and build out screens further</li>
<li>Complete styling and enhance user experience</li>
</ol>
<p>As I was confronted with challenges, I consulted various online resources such as Stack Overflow. Also, reaching out to fellow developers with experience building out various features, such as tabs, was helpful.</p>

<h3>Future Fixes and Enhancements:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement an upvoting feature</li>
<li>Allow users to save routines as favorites and access via a separate tab or filter</li>
<li>Allow users to search routines based on various criteria such as routine type</li>
</ul>
